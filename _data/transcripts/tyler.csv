Like you go in, again while they're at work of somethin', and you take a light bulb. You know when it's inset into the wall and you take and you break the bulb but you make it so the fillament is still intact and you put it up in there, and you take like an M80 or a dixie bomb or something so it's hooked to it, so it's set it off-- then you take a bag of shit, whatever kind of shit you want: human, dog, you know...cat. Whatever kind of shit you want. Then they come in and they turn the light on and it lights the firework and it just blows shit all over there house. It's amazing.
